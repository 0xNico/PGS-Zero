People Governed Software License 0 (PGS0)

Preamble

This document, known as the People Governed Software License 0 (PGS0), provides a structured legal framework designed specifically for the governance, usage, and dissemination of decentralized, immutable software that is administered through Decentralized Autonomous Markets (DAMs). By adopting this license, all parties, including developers, contributors, and users, engage with software in a manner that emphasizes and supports transparency, decentralized governance, and the immutable, community-driven ethos inherent in such technologies. This license aims to embody and enforce the principles that sustain decentralized applications as instruments of social and economic empowerment.

I. Definitions

"Software": The computer programs, databases, associated documentation, and all other digital materials managed under this license, including original and subsequent versions developed and modified under PGS0.
"Contributor": Any individual or entity that provides code, documentation, or other contributions to the Software.
"User": Any individual or entity that interacts with, operates, or utilizes the Software in any capacity.
"DAM (Decentralized Autonomous Market)": A non-centralized governance framework where decisions are made through collective consensus of market participants rather than centralized authority, specifically structured around the principles of autonomous operation and market-driven decision-making.
"Contribution": Any code, documentation, improvement, or other forms of input intended to enhance the Software, offered by Contributors.

II. Scope of the License

This License regulates the rights and obligations relating to the Software, detailing what is permissible under the terms set forth herein. It applies to all iterations of the Software, whether past, present, or future, governed by the terms of PGS0 unless explicitly superseded or modified by subsequent licenses.

III. Contributions and Rights

Freedom of Expression: Contributions are made under the banner of free expression, where Contributors offer their services or intellectual property without expectation of direct compensation and without their contributions being an endorsement by any organization.
Autonomy in Contributions: Contributions once made do not reflect any organizational intent or endorsement when incorporated into the Software. The DAM's decision to use a contribution is based solely on its utility and value to the Software, independent of the Contributor's personal or political beliefs.

IV. Liability and Governance

Decentralized Governance: Governance of the Software is vested in the DAM, which operates without centralized control, facilitating a participatory and democratic decision-making process.
Responsibility and Liability: The User is solely responsible for their use of the Software and must comply with all applicable laws. Contributors are not liable for how their contributions are used within the Software. The DAM or the Software itself does not enforce legal compliance; this responsibility rests entirely with the User.
Liability Limitation: Contributors are provided absolute protection from liability for the use of their contributions in the Software, even beyond what is typically allowed under applicable law. Only the User who misuses the Software bears full legal responsibility.

V. Protection Against Misuse

User Accountability: Users are solely responsible for their actions while utilizing the Software. In cases of misuse, only the offending User is held accountable.
Immutability and Permanence: Contributions that are integrated into the Software become immutable and cannot be altered or removed, emphasizing the permanent and unchangeable nature of blockchain-based deployments.

VI. Rights Reserved and Recourse

Legal Actions and Recourse: This License allows Users and Contributors to pursue legal recourse, including initiating class-action lawsuits, against any party that acts in a manner that damages the integrity, functionality, or public standing of the Software.

VII. Dynamic and Evolving Nature of the License

Non-evolutionary Clause: PGS0 does not evolve; it remains as is. Future iterations or modifications can be developed independently and will be recognized as separate entities (e.g., PGS1), not reflecting the provisions of PGS0.

VIII. Intellectual Property

Separate Copyright Handling: Intellectual property rights are managed separately from this License. Contributors retain individual copyright over their contributions, and such rights are governed under separate agreements.

IX. Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution

Governing Law: This License and any disputes related to it are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the DAM is legally recognized or operates, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Dispute Resolution: Disputes arising under this License are resolved through arbitration or other agreed-upon forms of alternative dispute resolution, ensuring expedient and fair handling of legal issues.

X. Conclusion

This License is a testament to the power of decentralized governance and the belief that software, when maintained by its community, can serve as a powerful tool for social and economic reform. It empowers users, protects contributors, and fosters a sustainable environment for the continued development and use of decentralized software.
